# AcmeShield

![alt text](ExampleImage.png "Title")
A secured HTTP proxy that forwards requests to a remote service(Postman). This is a tool that will proxy simple HTTPS requests to an external HTTP endpoint (service in the image above)

## Description

The HTTP proxy operates between the sending Web server and your receiving Web client. It processes the HTTP protocol line-by-line for any potentially harmful content before sending it to an internal Web client. It also acts as a buffer between your Web server and potentially harmful Web clients by enforcing HTTP RFC compliance and preventing potential buffer overflow.
